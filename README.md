# Stake pool contract

This contract provides a way for other users to delegate funds to a pool of validation nodes.

There are some different roles:
- The staking pool contract. An account with the contract that staking pools funds.
- The staking pool is owned by the `owner` and the `owner` is the general manager of the staking pool.
- The pool `manager` manages the pool. The `manager` is assigned by the `owner` of the staking pool and can be changed anytime.
- Delegator accounts - accounts that want to stake their funds with the staking pool.
- Delegator accounts can become an `investor`.

## Reward distribution

The reward is distributed by increasing the exchange rate of the pool's native token at the beginning of each epoch.

Every epoch validators bring rewards to the pool. So, at the beginning of each epoch, the pool synchronizes and updates the information about the native tokens under management from all validators and calculates a new exchange rate for the native token.

## Stake pool contract guarantees and invariants

This staking pool implementation guarantees the required properties of the staking pool standard:

- The contract can't lose or lock tokens of users.
- If a user deposited X, the user should be able to withdraw at least X.
- If a user successfully staked X, the user can unstake at least X.
- The contract should not lock unstaked funds for longer than 8 epochs after delayed withdraw action.

It also has inner invariants:

- The price of staking pool tokens is always at least `1`.
- The price of staking pool tokens never decreases.
- The comission is a fraction be from `0` to `1` inclusive.
- The owner can't withdraw funds from other delegators.

## Implementation details

The owner can set up such contract with different parameters and start receiving users native tokens.
Any other user can send their native tokens to the contract and increase the total stake distributed on validators and receive staking pool fungible tokens.
These users are rewarded by increasing the rate of the staking pool tokens they received, but the contract has the right to charge a commission.
Then users can withdraw their native tokens after some unlocking period by exchanging staking pool tokens.

The price of a staking pool token defined as the total amount of staked native tokens divided by the total amount of staking pool token.
The number of staking pool token is always less than the number of the staked native tokens, so the price of single staking pool token is not less than `1`.

## Existing `call` methods:
- `new`

Available for pool owner.

Initializes staking pool state.

    fungible_token_metadata: FungibleTokenMetadataDto,
    manager_id: Option<AccountId>,
    self_fee_receiver_account_id: AccountId,
    partner_fee_receiver_account_id: AccountId,

- `deposit`

Available for all users.

The delegator makes a deposit of funds, and receiving pool tokens in return.
When a delegator account first deposits funds to the contract, the internal account is created and credited with the
`near_amount` native tokens. The attached deposit must be greater than `near_amount` to hide the storage staking,
with the excess fund being refunded.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn deposit(&mut self, near_amount: U128) -> PromiseOrValue<()>
```
near call pool.testnet deposit '{"near_amount": "10000000000000000000000000"}' --deposit=2 --accountId=account3.testnet --gas=300000000000000

- `deposit_on_validator`

Available for investors.

The delegator makes a deposit of funds via pool directly to validator, and receiving pool tokens in return.
When a delegator account first deposits funds to the contract, the internal account is created and credited with the
`near_amount` native tokens. The attached deposit must be greater than `near_amount` to hide the storage staking,
with the excess fund being refunded.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn deposit_on_validator(&mut self, near_amount: U128, validator_account_id: AccountId) -> Promise
```
near call pool.testnet deposit_on_validator '{"near_amount": "1000000000000000000000000", "validator_account_id": "legends.pool.f863973.m0"}' --accountId=account3.testnet --deposit=2 --gas=300000000000000

- `instant_withdraw`

Available for all users.

The delegator makes an instant unstake by exchanging the pool tokens he has for native tokens. Native tokens are returned
to the delegator immediately, so there may be a commission for this action.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn instant_withdraw(&mut self, token_amount: U128) -> Promise
```
near call pool.testnet instant_withdraw '{"token_amount":"1000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId=account3.testnet --deposit=1 --gas=300000000000000

- `delayed_withdraw`

Available for all users.

The delegator makes an unstake by exchanging the pool tokens he has for native tokens. Native tokens can be returned
to the delegator only after 8 epochs.

```rust
#[payable]
pub fn delayed_withdraw(&mut self, token_amount: U128) -> PromiseOrValue<()>
```
near call pool.testnet delayed_withdraw '{"token_amount": "1000000000000000000000000"}' --accountId=account3.testnet --deposit=1 --gas=300000000000000

- `delayed_withdraw_from_validator`

Available for investors.

to the delegator only after 8 epochs.
